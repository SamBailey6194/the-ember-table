# Sprint Iterations

Each iteration will have around 10 story points, two of them have slightly higher due to the need to complete those user stories at the same time as another user story for better functionality.

A reminder the story point system is the fibonnachi sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, etc). I have also used the MoSCoW Priority system.
